# Credit Default Prediction System (CDPS)

The Credit Default Prediction System (CDPS) is an AI-driven solution that predicts the likelihood of loan default by analyzing borrowersâ€™ financial data and behavioral patterns. Built using machine learning and feature engineering techniques, it helps financial institutions assess credit risk accurately and transparently. The system processes user-submitted financial records in real time, segments applicants into risk categories (high, medium, low), and provides clear, personalized feedback on loan approvals or rejections. It also offers tailored loan terms and multilingual support to ensure inclusivity. By addressing issues like class imbalance, lack of transparency, and accessibility, CDPS aims to make lending smarter, fairer, and more efficient.
